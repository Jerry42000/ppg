# Photoplethysmography (PPG) Heart-Rate & HRV Monitor

A lightweight Streamlit app that estimates heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV) from a fingertip video (PPG). It also includes a rule-based rhythm classification preview (e.g., sinus rhythm or irregular patterns). 

⚠️ Medical disclaimer
This tool is designed for educational and wellness purposes. It DOES NOT provide medical diagnosis, medical advice, or clinical monitoring.
ECG vs PPG: Electrocardiography (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart from electrodes on the skin and is the clinical standard for arrhythmia diagnosis. Photoplethysmography (PPG) measures optical changes in blood volume in the finger. Because PPG does not capture electrical signals, it can mimic irregularity (motion, light changes, poor contact) and cannot reliably differentiate many arrhythmias. Always consult a healthcare professional if you feel unwell.
